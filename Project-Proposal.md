# Project proposal

## Project Description
A mobile app for individuals and friends to track their wins from a variety of activities in a centralized location.

## Problem statement
Currently, people either need to open several applications to check activity scores or don't have anywhere official to record activity scores. Because of this, there is no way to see your total individual wins or your wins compared to the wins of your friends.

## How will your project solve this problem?
This app will allow users to track and view all of their wins in one place, view their friends' wins, and compare their wins with the wins of their friends.

## Map the user experience
The user will have their own profile where they can record different types of wins in whichever activity they participate in. The user's wins will be public to their friends(other users of the app), and the user will be able to compare their scores to their friends' scores. Activities can be recorded individually or in groups. If the activity doesn't exist, a new activity can be created along with win categories associated with the activity.

## What technologies do you plan to use?
NativeScript-Vue, HTML, CSS, Knex, Express, PostgreSQL, Heroku, and Firebase.
